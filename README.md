# QAproject2
## Author - Kieran Armstrong

## Objective 
To create a simple application which consists of four services that work together in order to achieve functionality. 
Service one will be used to render templates and communicate with the other three services. 
Services two and three will both generate a random object, which will both be used to create an object in service four.

The application will generate a basketball player template. Service two will generate a player position and service three will generate a playstyle. Service four will then use these to generate the player template. Service one will then deliver this information to the user.

## Project Management
### Trello
I have decided to use Trello for the purpose of project management. I decided to use Trello as it provides a visual and user-friendly interface for keeping track of tasks, allowing me to manage my time efficiently. It also has features that allow for storing documentation in a centralised location, making it easier to organise the necessary documentation.
